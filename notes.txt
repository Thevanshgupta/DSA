data type: Primitive & non Primitive

Primitive: numeric & void & non numeric

numeric: Exact & approx
exact : int bool

approx: single(float) & double(double)

non numeric: char& wide char& void

non- Primitive: derived and user define data type(UDA)

derived: Array & F(n) & pointer & reference(c++)


UDA: typedef & union & enum & struct & class

deep copy vs shallow copy: 




Methods: function in the class is callled methods:
ways to declare methods in C++: inside class and outside the class
:    methods define and declared in the class I(inside class methdos)
:   methods declared in the class I(inside class methdos) but define outside class using scope resolution operator.


constructor : special member in c++ which is automatically involed or called when the object of the class is created
key points: 
    1. constructor name == class name: constructor have same name in c++
    2. automatically invoked when at the time of object creation.
    3.  for the every time memory is allocated when object creation
    4. they dont have 
    with respect parametrized structure we can pass the aruments at the time of object creation with the help paratheses ()

    note should always public.


    types of constructor:
    majorly 3 types:
    1 default: automatically invoked or impecity passed with the language processor when do not create any constructor
    2 parametrized: a constructor doest have any parameters
    3 

encapsulation: rapping of data as member function and in single unit is knows as encapsulation
